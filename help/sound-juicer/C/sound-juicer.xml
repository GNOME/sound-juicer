  <para>&application; is a simple and clean CD ripping tool. It allows you
  to extract the audio from audio compact discs and convert them into audio
  files that your computer can understand and play.</para>

  <para>&application; is designed to be easy to use and to work with little
  user intervention.  For example, if your computer is connected to the
  Internet, it will automatically attempt to retrieve track information
  from the freely-available <ulink
  url="http://www.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</ulink> service.</para>
</section>

<section id="using">
  <title>Using &application;</title>

  <para>When you start &application;, it will examine the CD in the selected
  drive and try to locate information about its audio tracks.  It can match
  against the serial number of the CD as well as the lengths and positions of
  the tracks.  Occasionally, another CD may have the same layout, causing
  the wrong track information to be displayed.  If this happens, you will
  have to enter the information manually.</para>

  <para>This is what &application; typically looks like when started with
  an audio CD in the drive:</para>

  <figure>
    <title>&application; on Startup</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>

	  <imagedata fileref="figures/startup" format="PNG"/>

	  <phrase>&application; on startup</phrase>
	</textobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>The top of the window contains controls for the title, artist,
  and genre of the CD.  Below that is a list of the audio tracks on the
  CD.  You can set the track and artist for each track.  &application;
  uses this information to name the folders and files where your music
  is stored.  In addition, the track and album information is encoded
  directly into the audio files.  Many music players, including portable
  devices and car stereos, use this information to organize and display
  the audio files.</para>

  <para>To edit the title of a track, first select the track, then click
  on the title.  When you have finished entering the title, press the
  <keycap>Enter</keycap> key on your keyboard, or click outside the
  title.</para>

  <para>When you edit the artist for the CD, the artist for each track
  is automatically updated.  Most CDs are by a single artist, and this
  feature saves you the time of entering the artist for each track.</para>

  <para>Some CDs, however, are compilations of songs by different artists.
  For these CDs, you will have to enter the artist for each track.  To set
  the artist for a track, first select the track, then click on the artist.
  You can set the artist for the CD to a value like "Various" or simply
  leave it blank, depending on how you prefer to organize your music.</para>

  <para>By default, &application; will extract all of the tracks on the CD
  to audio files.  If you do not wish to extract all of the tracks, you can
  control which tracks are extracted using the check boxes in the
  <guilabel>Extract</guilabel> column of the track listing.  Only the tracks
  you have selected will be extracted.</para>

  <para>Whenever possible, &application; will detect when a new CD has been
  inserted and re-read the track information.  On certain types of computers,
  it may not be techically possible to determine automatically when a new CD
  has been inserted.  In this case, you can always click on the
  <guibutton>Re-read</guibutton> button to re-read the track information
  from the CD in the drive.</para>

  <para>When you have entered all the information you need, click on the
  <guibutton>Extract</guibutton> button.  &application; will begin reading
  the audio from the CD and saving it to files on your computer.  By default,
  the audio files are stored under the <filename>Music</filename> folder in
  your home folder.</para>

  <para>Extracting a CD can take a long time, depending on the speed of your
  computer.  You can safely minimize &application; or move to another workspace
  to continue using your computer while the audio is being extracted.</para>

<section id="preferences">
  <title>Preferences</title>

  <para>The preferences window allows you to control:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Which CD drive &application; uses if you have more than
    one drive,</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Where the extracted audio files are placed on your

  <section id="prefs-drive">
    <title>Selecting a CD Drive</title>

    <para>If you have multiple CD drives in your computer, the drop-down list
    labelled <guilabel>CD drive</guilabel> allows you to select which drive to
    use by default.  The check box <guibutton>Eject when finished</guibutton>
    allows you to control whether &application; will eject the CD from the
    drive when it has finished extracting the audio files.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="prefs-naming">
    <title>Naming Audio Files</title>

    <para>The <guilabel>Music Folder</guilabel> drop-down list allows you to
    select which folder to store your audio files in.  Select one of the
    folders from the list, or choose <guilabel>Other</guilabel> to select
    another folder with the file chooser.  By default, files are placed
    under the <filename>Music</filename> folder in your home folder.</para>

    <para>The <guilabel>Track Names</guilabel> allows you to control how
    the files and folders are named.  &application; can store audio files
    in seperate folders, helping you keep your music organized.  You can
    choose how these folders are created and named using the
    <guilabel>Folder hierarchy</guilabel> drop-down list.  By default,
    &application; creates a folder for the album artist and a subfolder
    for the album.</para>

    <para>Use the <guilabel>File name</guilabel> drop-down list to select
    how the audio files are named.  By default, &application; uses the track
    number followed by a hyphen and the track title.  Selecting the
    <guibutton>Strip special characters</guibutton> check box causes
    &application; to remove or replace characters such as spaces and
    punctuation in the filenames.</para>

    <note><para>Even when <guibutton>Strip special characters</guibutton>
    is not selected, &application; will remove the <literal>/</literal>
    character from filenames.  This character cannot be used in any
    filenames on UNIX, Linux, and similar systems.</para></note>
  </section>

  <section id="prefs-format">
    <title>Selecting a Format</title>

    <para>You can select which audio file format &application; uses to store
    your tracks on your computer.  There are a number of available formats,
    each with its own advantages.  The available formats on your computer
    may vary, but the following choices are usually available:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>CD Quality, Lossy (Ogg Vorbis audio)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>This option is selected by default.
	  <ulink url="http://www.vorbis.org/">Ogg Vorbis</ulink>, like other
	  lossy audio formats (such as MP3 and AAC) discards some information
	  from the original audio data.  Although the audio file is not a
	  perfect replica of the CD audio, the differences are often not
	  distinguishable to most listeners.  As a result, lossy formats
	  tend to have very small file sizes.</para>

	  <para>The Ogg Vorbis format is the default lossy format used in
	  &application;.  Ogg Vorbis is an open format, developed by the
	  <ulink url="http://xiph.org/">Xiph.Org Foundation</ulink>, which
	  tends to produce smaller file sizes and higher quality audio than
	  many other lossy formats.  While it is not as widespread as the
	  older MP3 format, most music software can play Ogg Vorbis files,
	  and many hardware players have incorporated support.</para>

	  <para>Xiph.Org maintains lists of <ulink
	  url="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/VorbisSoftwarePlayers">software
	  players</ulink>, <ulink
	  url="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/PortablePlayers">portable
	  hardware players</ulink>, and <ulink
	  url="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/StaticPlayers">static hardware
	  players</ulink> which support Ogg Vorbis.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>CD Quality, Lossless (FLAC audio)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The <ulink url="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</ulink>
	  audio format is a lossless format.  That is, no audio data is lost
	  when converting to FLAC, even though it compresses audio files by
	  as much as 70%.  FLAC and other lossless formats are popular in
	  cases where high fidelity audio is needed, but files need to be
	  compressed to save disk space and network transfer times.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Voice (WAV audio)</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>The Voice output profile produces low-quality mono audio
	  files.  You may wish to select this for lectures, books on tape,
	  and other spoken word CDs, where the loss in audio quality is
	  less important.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
      <tip>
        <para>If you need to store tracks in the MP3 format (for example,
        because your portable music player only supports MP3 and not Ogg
        Vorbis), you will need to create a new profile.  To do this, run
        <application>gnome-audio-profiles-properties</application>, press
          <guibutton>New</guibutton> and name it <userinput>MP3</userinput>.
          Then press <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> and set <guilabel>GStreamer
            Pipeline</guilabel> to
            <userinput>audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lame
            name=enc</userinput>, the
          <guilabel>File Extenstion</guilabel> to <userinput>mp3</userinput>,
          and check <guibutton>Active</guibutton>. Then start &application; and
          select the <guilabel>MP3</guilabel> format.</para>
        <para>This profile uses the <application>LAME</application> MP3 encoder,
          so you will need to have the GStreamer LAME plugin installed.</para>
