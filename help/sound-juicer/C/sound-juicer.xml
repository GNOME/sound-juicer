    <para>&application; is a simple and clean CD ripping tool. It allows you
      to extract the audio from audio compact discs and convert them into audio
      files that your computer can understand and play.</para>

    <para>&application; is designed to be easy to use and to work with little
      user intervention.  For example, if your computer is connected to the
      Internet, it will automatically attempt to retrieve track information
      from the freely-available <ulink
        url="http://www.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</ulink> service.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="using">
    <title>Using &application;</title>

    <para>When you start &application;, it will examine the CD in the selected
      drive and try to locate information about its audio tracks.  It can match
      against the serial number of the CD as well as the lengths and positions of
      the tracks.  Occasionally, another CD may have the same layout, causing
      the wrong track information to be displayed.  If this happens, you will
      have to enter the information manually.</para>

    <para>This is what &application; typically looks like when started with
      an audio CD in the drive:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>&application; on Startup</title>
      <screenshot>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="figures/startup" format="PNG"/>
          </imageobject>
          <textobject>
            <phrase>&application; on startup</phrase>
          </textobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para>The top of the window contains controls for the title, artist,
      and genre of the CD.  Below that is a list of the audio tracks on the
      CD.  You can set the track and artist for each track.  &application;
      uses this information to name the folders and files where your music
      is stored.  In addition, the track and album information is encoded
      directly into the audio files.  Many music players, including portable
      devices and car stereos, use this information to organize and display
      the audio files.</para>

    <para>To edit the title of a track, first select the track, then click
      on the title.  When you have finished entering the title, press the
      <keycap>Enter</keycap> key on your keyboard, or click outside the
      title.</para>

    <para>When you edit the artist for the CD, the artist for each track
      is automatically updated.  Most CDs are by a single artist, and this
      feature saves you the time of entering the artist for each track.</para>

    <para>Some CDs, however, are compilations of songs by different artists.
      For these CDs, you will have to enter the artist for each track.  To set
      the artist for a track, first select the track, then click on the artist.
      You can set the artist for the CD to a value like "Various" or simply
      leave it blank, depending on how you prefer to organize your music.</para>

    <para>By default, &application; will extract all of the tracks on the CD
      to audio files.  If you do not wish to extract all of the tracks, you can
      control which tracks are extracted using the check boxes in the
      <guilabel>Extract</guilabel> column of the track listing.  Only the tracks
      you have selected will be extracted.</para>

    <para>Whenever possible, &application; will detect when a new CD has been
      inserted and re-read the track information.  On certain types of computers,
      it may not be techically possible to determine automatically when a new CD
      has been inserted.  In this case, you can always click on the
      <guibutton>Re-read</guibutton> button to re-read the track information
      from the CD in the drive.</para>

    <para>When you have entered all the information you need, click on the
      <guibutton>Extract</guibutton> button.  &application; will begin reading
      the audio from the CD and saving it to files on your computer.  By default,
      the audio files are stored under the <filename>Music</filename> folder in
      your home folder.</para>

    <para>Extracting a CD can take a long time, depending on the speed of your
      computer.  You can safely minimize &application; or move to another workspace
      to continue using your computer while the audio is being extracted.</para>

      <title>Selecting a CD Drive</title>

      <para>If you have multiple CD drives in your computer, the drop-down list
        labelled <guilabel>CD drive</guilabel> allows you to select which drive to
        use by default.  The check box <guibutton>Eject when finished</guibutton>
        allows you to control whether &application; will eject the CD from the
        drive when it has finished extracting the audio files.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="prefs-naming">
      <title>Naming Audio Files</title>

      <para>The <guilabel>Music Folder</guilabel> drop-down list allows you to
        select which folder to store your audio files in.  Select one of the
        folders from the list, or choose <guilabel>Other</guilabel> to select
        another folder with the file chooser.  By default, files are placed
        under the <filename>Music</filename> folder in your home folder.</para>

      <para>The <guilabel>Track Names</guilabel> allows you to control how
        the files and folders are named.  &application; can store audio files
        in seperate folders, helping you keep your music organized.  You can
        choose how these folders are created and named using the
        <guilabel>Folder hierarchy</guilabel> drop-down list.  By default,
        &application; creates a folder for the album artist and a subfolder
        for the album.</para>

      <para>Use the <guilabel>File name</guilabel> drop-down list to select
        how the audio files are named.  By default, &application; uses the track
        number followed by a hyphen and the track title.  Selecting the
        <guibutton>Strip special characters</guibutton> check box causes
        &application; to remove or replace characters such as spaces and
        punctuation in the filenames.</para>

      <note><para>Even when <guibutton>Strip special characters</guibutton>
          is not selected, &application; will remove the <literal>/</literal>
          character from filenames.  This character cannot be used in any
          filenames on UNIX, Linux, and similar systems.</para></note>
    </section>

    <section id="prefs-format">
      <title>Selecting a Format</title>

      <para>You can select which audio file format &application; uses to store
        your tracks on your computer.  There are a number of available formats,
        each with its own advantages.  The available formats on your computer
        may vary, but the following choices are usually available:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>CD Quality, Lossy (Ogg Vorbis audio)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This option is selected by default.
              <ulink url="http://www.vorbis.org/">Ogg Vorbis</ulink>, like other
              lossy audio formats (such as MP3 and AAC) discards some information
              from the original audio data.  Although the audio file is not a
              perfect replica of the CD audio, the differences are often not
              distinguishable to most listeners.  As a result, lossy formats
              tend to have very small file sizes.</para>

            <para>The Ogg Vorbis format is the default lossy format used in
              &application;.  Ogg Vorbis is an open format, developed by the
              <ulink url="http://xiph.org/">Xiph.Org Foundation</ulink>, which
              tends to produce smaller file sizes and higher quality audio than
              many other lossy formats.  While it is not as widespread as the
              older MP3 format, most music software can play Ogg Vorbis files,
              and many hardware players have incorporated support.</para>

            <para>Xiph.Org maintains lists of <ulink
                url="http://wiki.xiph.org/index.php/VorbisSoftwarePlayers">software
                players</ulink>, <ulink

                players</ulink> which support Ogg Vorbis.</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>CD Quality, Lossless (FLAC audio)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The <ulink url="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</ulink>
              audio format is a lossless format.  That is, no audio data is lost
              when converting to FLAC, even though it compresses audio files by
              as much as 70%.  FLAC and other lossless formats are popular in
              cases where high fidelity audio is needed, but files need to be
              compressed to save disk space and network transfer times.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Voice (WAV audio)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The Voice output profile produces low-quality mono audio
              files.  You may wish to select this for lectures, books on tape,
              and other spoken word CDs, where the loss in audio quality is
              less important.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <tip>
        <para>If you need to store tracks in the MP3 format (for example,
          because your portable music player only supports MP3 and not Ogg
          Vorbis), you will need to create a new profile.  To do this, run
          <application>gnome-audio-profiles-properties</application>, press
          <guibutton>New</guibutton> and name it <userinput>MP3</userinput>.
          Then press <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> and set <guilabel>GStreamer
            Pipeline</guilabel> to
          <userinput>audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lame
            name=enc</userinput>, the
          <guilabel>File Extenstion</guilabel> to <userinput>mp3</userinput>,
          and check <guibutton>Active</guibutton>. Then start &application; and
          select the <guilabel>MP3</guilabel> format.</para>
        <para>This profile uses the <application>LAME</application> MP3 encoder,
          so you will need to have the GStreamer LAME plugin installed.</para>
