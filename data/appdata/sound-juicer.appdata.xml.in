      Sound Juicer is a simple and clean CD ripping tool.
      It allows you to extract the audio from audio compact discs and convert
      them into audio files that your computer can understand and play.
      Sound Juicer can also play the audio tracks directly from the CD, allowing
      you to preview the CD before ripping it.
    </_p>
    <_p>
      Sound Juicer is designed to be easy to use, and to work with little user
      intervention.
      When you start Sound Juicer, it will examine the CD in the drive and try
      to locate information about the audio tracks using the freely-available
      MusicBrainz service.
