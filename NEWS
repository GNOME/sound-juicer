Sound Juicer "Where Beer Does Flow And Men Do Chunder" 0.6.0
===========================================================

This is the first release in the 0.6 series.  It's a bit rough, so be gentle
with it.  In particular, you can only encode to Ogg Vorbis and FLAC unless you
create new audio profiles.

* Handle unset values in GConf (Colin Walters)
* Fixed HAL compile (Colin Walters and Sjoerd Simons)


Sound Juicer "Desire Is The Father Of Invention" 0.5.13
=======================================================

Yes, I've now got an iPod and decided after all to add a genre drop-down.
MusicBrainz doesn't do genre so you've got to set it yourself.  Help me by
sending in patches to sj-genres.c to alias one genre to another -- the ID3 list
is *way* to long.

a start...
