I've been really bad at crediting translators, so I'll credit everyone who
translated since 0.6 and will try and keep this up.  Thanks everyone!

Sound Juicer "So Said The Preacher Man" 2.9.91
==============================================

First official beta for GNOME 2.10, so several last-minute fixes:

* Link to nautilus-burn instead of copying libbacon
* HIGify and use GtkFileChooserButton in the Preferences dialog
* Use gnome-open instead of Nautilus when opening directories
* Ensure the pipeline is not running when an error occurs
* Make the code more likely to compile with gcc 2.95
* Update README
* Write empty strings, no NULL, to GConf


Sound Juicer "Where Beer Does Flow And Men Do Chunder" 0.6.0
===========================================================

This is the first release in the 0.6 series.  It's a bit rough, so be gentle
with it.  In particular, you can only encode to Ogg Vorbis and FLAC unless you
create new audio profiles.

* Now uses Audio Profiles for encoding
* Expanded metadata tags
* HAL-enabled builds actually compile
* Time remaining calculations actually work (hondaguru@earthlink.net)
* Handle filename conversion failures (Frederic Crozat)
* Handle empty results from MusicBrainz (FC)
* Disable Select/Deselect All when extracting (Raj Madhan)
* Don't crash at startup when there is no profile defined (RM)
* Handle unset audio profile keys (RM)
* Ensure Select/Deselect All reflect the state of the selections (Nirmal Kumar)
* Warn the user if they try and exit whilst ripping (RM)
* The Close button is the default when extracting is complete

Sound Juicer "Bust The Meter" 0.5.14
====================================

* Don't corrupt the title/artist entries when changing CD
* Sort the genre list at runtime (Christophe Fergeau)
* Handle unset values in GConf (Colin Walters)
* Fixed HAL compile (Colin Walters and Sjoerd Simons)


Sound Juicer "Desire Is The Father Of Invention" 0.5.13
=======================================================

Yes, I've now got an iPod and decided after all to add a genre drop-down.
MusicBrainz doesn't do genre so you've got to set it yourself.  Help me by
sending in patches to sj-genres.c to alias one genre to another -- the ID3 list
is *way* to long.

* Add a genre drop-down
* Update CD code, and use HAL if available
* Depend on GTK+ 2.4 and use the new file chooser
* Don't corrupt data if the disc is changed whilst the Rip Complete dialogue is
  open (Sean Proctor)
* More charset escaping (Frederic Crozat)
* Add more GStreamer iterate functions to speed ripping (David Arnold)
* Be a bit more paranoid about incorrect GConf keys
* Allow the MusicBrainz server to be changed
* Lots of little bug fixes but lots of fabby people.


Sound Juicer "Bust The Meter" 0.5.12

* Use a sane drive if the one in GConf doesn't exist (Bastien Nocera)

* Mark Eject for localisation (Stephane Raimbault)
* Don't crash if the files exists and the user skips every track
* Make the Help button work (Brent Fox)
* Add double quotes to the set of characters to strip when sanitising paths
* Handle the GStreamer 0.8 error callback prototype (Christophe Fergeau IIRC)
* Stop building with SJ 0.7.x
* Update libbacon
* Add colons to the Prefs dialog


Sound Juicer "One More Victim" 0.5.11
=====================================

* Supports GStreamer 0.8

Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC may not work due to a bug in GStreamer, but it's
a start...
