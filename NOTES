Either pass in an AlbumDetails* to sj_gstreamer_extract_track(), or
put an AlbumDetails* into each TrackDetails. This means we can set the
album name.

Use GConf. Keys so far:
/apps/sound-juicer/base_path (string, default "")
/apps/sound-juicer/device (string, default "")

GErrorify everywhere!

Instead of using an int counter, lookup the track number too?
