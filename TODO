Do a CD lookup using gnome-media's CDDB library

GObjectify the CD lookup code.

Make the musicbrainz lookup async?

Make the track list editable, so the user can override the
title/artist.

For the future, add a button to submit the current titles

Play/stop track. Not a full CD player, but simple play/stop should be
enough.

Maybe add a button to start the users CD player (as determined by
magicdev?)

SjExtractor's constructor wants to return a GError if it fails. How do
I do this with GObject?

Watch the CD drive so the UI updates when a disk is inserted/removed.

Now I do the sensible thing and select all tracks by default, do I need Select All?

Depend on gstreamer 0.6.1

UI to set base path

UI to set filename format

Handle libmusicbrainz 2.0.0 by looking for the headers manually.

See if I use the new features of libmusicbrainz 2, or if 1.10 is enough.

Write some user documentation.

Remove every g_print and replace with groovy dialogs.

Find out why when an error dialog pops up before the main window, I get:
  (sound-juicer:28417): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkwindow.c: line 2426
  (gtk_window_realize_icon): assertion `info->icon_pixmap == NULL'
  failed
when the main window appears unless I can gtk_widget_realize(main_window) first?
