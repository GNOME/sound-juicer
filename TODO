Do a CD lookup using gnome-media's CDDB library

GObjectify the CD lookup code.

Make the musicbrainz lookup async?

For the future, add a button to submit the current titles

Play/stop track. Not a full CD player, but simple play/stop should be
enough.

Maybe add a button to start the users CD player (as determined by
magicdev keys?)

Watch the CD drive so the UI updates when a disk is inserted/removed.

Now I do the sensible thing and select all tracks by default, do I need Select All?

Depend on gstreamer 0.6.1

Handle libmusicbrainz 2.0.0 by looking for the headers manually.

See if I use the new features of libmusicbrainz 2, or if 1.10 is enough.

Write some user documentation.

Remove every g_print and replace with groovy dialogs.

Find out why when an error dialog pops up before the main window, I get:
  (sound-juicer:28417): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkwindow.c: line 2426
  (gtk_window_realize_icon): assertion `info->icon_pixmap == NULL'
  failed
when the main window appears unless I can gtk_widget_realize(main_window) first?

Make the progress dialog modal, or disable the Extract button when ripping

Need to handle the case when files exist. At the moment they are written over.
