Create a GConf schema file.

I'd like to be able to check for cdparanoia, vorbisenc, etc GST
plugins at configure time. Get the m4 macro to do this from
gst-plugins.

Do a CD lookup using gnome-media's CDDB library

GObjectify the CD lookup code.

Make the musicbrainz lookup async?

Make the track list editable, so the user can override the
title/artist.

For the future, add a button to submit the current titles

Play/stop track. Not a full CD player, but simple play/stop should be
enough.

SjExtractor's constructor wants to return a GError if it fails. How do
I do this with GObject?

Watch the CD drive so the UI updates when a disk is inserted/removed.
