Do a CD lookup using gnome-media's CDDB library

For the future, add a button to submit the current titles

Play/stop track. Not a full CD player, but simple play/stop should be
enough.

Maybe add a button to start the users CD player (as determined by
g-v-m keys?)

Remove Reread button from dialog?

Use put icon in hicolor theme and stop loading it manually

Put SjExtractor and SjMetadata classes in a shared library
