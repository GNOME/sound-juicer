Do a CD lookup using gnome-media's CDDB library

GObjectify the CD lookup code.

Make the musicbrainz lookup async?

For the future, add a button to submit the current titles

Play/stop track. Not a full CD player, but simple play/stop should be
enough.

Maybe add a button to start the users CD player (as determined by
magicdev keys?)

Watch the CD drive so the UI updates when a disk is inserted/removed.

Remove every g_print and replace with groovy dialogs.
