I must also create a GConf schema file.

I'd like to be able to check for cdparanoia, vorbisenc, etc GST
plugins at configure time. Get the m4 macro to do this from
gst-plugins.

If the track durations are known, show album progress based on
seconds. To do this, store the total and current seconds.

Do a CD lookup using gnome-media's CDDB library

Make the musicbrainz lookup async?

Is there a cdda2wav plugin for gst? cdparanoia is sloow.

GObjectify the CD lookup code.
