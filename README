Sound Juicer

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

It's not finished.

src/ contains the code sort of works.

test/ is where I've been trying out code and ideas.

Currently test/glade-test.c is the "application". I has ripped entire
albums, so it should work for you.

CVS GStreamer is required for the Ogg tagging to work correctly --
you'll get invalid tag messages with 0.6.0.

I will replace the function pointers in src/sj-gstreamer.c. I'll turn
it into a GObject with signals and properties and stuff. I'll do this
like in DevHelp so the actually code can be changed at compile
time. Sort out how to configure the encoder. GObject properties? maybe
a gtype enum of valid encodings. Or a method returning a GtkWidget*?

I must also create a GConf schema file.

Must decide if the refresh button should is "Re-read" or "Refresh"

I'd like to be able to check for cdparanoia, vorbisenc, etc GST
plugins at configure time. Anyone know how I do this?
