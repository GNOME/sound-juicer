Sound Juicer

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

It's not finished.

src/ contains the code sort of works.

test/ is where I've been trying out code and ideas.

Currently test/glade-test.c is the "application". I has ripped entire
albums, so it should work for you.

CVS GStreamer is required for the Ogg tagging to work correctly --
you'll get invalid tag messages with 0.6.0.
