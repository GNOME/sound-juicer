Sound Juicer

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

Requirements:
* GNOME 2.2 Platform (libgnomeui, gconf, libglade)
* GStreamer 0.6.x - and specifically the cdparanoia and vorbisenc
  elements.

Do the usual configure/make/make install malarky, and run
"sound-juicer" in $(prefix)/bin or "CD Ripper" in Applications ->
Sound & Video.

If the CD lookup is returning weird data, export MUSICBRAINZ_DEBUG
before running sound-juicer to turn debugging on in MusicBrainz. This
will show the chat between Sound Juicer and the MusicBrainz servers.

Known Issues:

For a complete To Do list, see the file TODO and the sound-juicer
product in the GNOME Bugzilla at http://bugzilla.gnome.org./

GStreamer 0.6.1 is required for the Ogg tagging to work correctly --
with 0.6.0 the comment field is encoded incorrectly and will give an
error message, but the other fields are written correctly.

Musicbrainz 2.0.1 is required. It should be a 10 minute hack to make
it work for 2.0.0, and maybe even for 1.1.0.

You need to have the 'cdparanoia' and 'vorbisenc' GStreamer elements
installed. The configure script will look for these and issue a
warning if they are not found.
