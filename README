Sound Juicer 0.2
Copyright (C) 2003 Ross Burton
Licensed under the GPL, version 2 or greater.

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

Requirements:
* GNOME 2.2 Platform (libgnomeui, gconf, libglade)
* GStreamer 0.6.x - and specifically the cdparanoia and vorbisenc
  elements.

Do the usual configure/make/make install malarky, and run
"sound-juicer" in $(prefix)/bin or "CD Ripper" in Applications ->
Sound & Video.


Known Issues:

For a complete To Do list, see the file TODO.

GStreamer 0.6.1 is required for the Ogg tagging to work correctly --
with 0.6.0 the comment field is encoded incorrectly and will give an
error message, but the other fields are written correctly.

There is no way in the UI to change the filename of music. It
currently uses "(basepath)/(album artist)/(album title)/(track number)
- (song title).ogg". This can be changed in GConf.

Musicbrainz 2.0.1 is required. It should be a 10 minute hack to make
it work for 2.0.0, and maybe even for 1.1.0.

You need to have the 'cdparanoia' and 'vorbisenc' GStreamer elements
installed. The configure script will look for these and issue a
warning if they are not found.
