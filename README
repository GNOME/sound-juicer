Sound Juicer 0.1
Copyright (C) 2003 Ross Burton

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

Do the usual configure/make/make install malarky, and run
"sound-juicer" in $(prefix)/bin or "CD Ripper" in Applications ->
Sound & Video.


Known Issues:

For a complete To Do list, see the file TODO.

GStreamer 0.6.1 (in CVS currently) is required for the Ogg tagging to
work correctly -- with 0.6.0 the comment field is encoded incorrectly
and will give an error message, but the other fields are written
correctly.

There is no way in the UI to select the output path. It defaults to
$HOME, and can be changed by editing the GConf key
/apps/sound-juicer/base_path.

There is no way in the UI to change the filename of music. It
currently uses "(basepath)/(album title)/(song title).ogg". To edit
this change pop_and_rip() in sj-extracting.c

Musicbrainz 2.0.1 is required. It should be a 10 minute hack to make
it work for 2.0.0, and maybe even for 1.1.0.

You need to have the 'cdparanoia' and 'vorbisenc' GStreamer elements
installed. The configure script will look for these and issue a
warning if they are not found. At the moment if they are not available
at run time Sound Juicer just exits. This will be fixed, don't panic.

It is recommended to run Sound Juicer first in a terminal, there are
still many messages which are not displayed in a dialog, but printed
to the console. Until you know it works for you, run in a terminal to
check.
