Sound Juicer

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

It's not finished.

src/ contains the code sort of works.

test/ is where I've been trying out code and ideas.

Currently test/glade-test.c is the "application". Once it managed to
rip two tracks of a CD I considered it "working", but it needs
testing...

CVS GStreamer is required for the Ogg tagging to work correctly --
you'll get invalid tag messages with 0.6.0.

Yes Kris, it could encode to mp3s.  Fiddle around in sj-gstreamer.c
and rewrite the pipeline. This may become an option in the future.

I will replace the function pointers in src/sj-gstreamer.c with GLib
signals, but as I said, this is all in flux at the moment. I'm still
undecided about the exact API for the ripper. I'll probably make it a
GObject or something.

I must also create a GConf schema file.
