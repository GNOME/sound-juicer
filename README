Sound Juicer

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

Requirements:
* GNOME 2.2 Platform (libgnomeui, gconf, libglade)
* GStreamer 0.6.x and above

Do the usual configure/make/make install malarky, and run
"sound-juicer" in $(prefix)/bin or "CD Ripper" in Applications ->
Sound & Video.

If the CD lookup is returning weird data, export MUSICBRAINZ_DEBUG
before running sound-juicer to turn debugging on in MusicBrainz. This
will show the chat between Sound Juicer and the MusicBrainz servers.


Common Problems
===============

"Sound Juicer doesn't start, it can't find a plugin to access the CD drive!"

You need the GStreamer cdparanoia plugin.  Most distributions should ship this
with GStreamer, if you built it youself check you have the cdparanoia headers
installed.

"I cannot encode to MP3!"

To encode to MP3 you need the GStreamer Lame plugin.  Most distributions don't
ship this due to patents and licence fees, so you will have to build lame
yourself, and then rebuild gstreamer-plugins.

"How do I set the quality?"

Patience is a virtue.  One day, soon, I shall implement quality selection with
the new Audio Profiles code in gnome-media 2.6. This will also remove the format
checkboxes.


Known Issues
============

For a complete To Do list, see the file TODO and the sound-juicer
product in the GNOME Bugzilla at http://bugzilla.gnome.org./

GStreamer 0.6.1 is required for the Ogg tagging to work correctly --
with 0.6.0 the comment field is encoded incorrectly and will give an
error message, but the other fields are written correctly.

Musicbrainz 2.0.1 is required. It should be a 10 minute hack to make
it work for 2.0.0, and maybe even for 1.1.0.
