Sound Juicer
Copyright (C) 2003 Ross Burton

This is Sound Juicer, a CD ripping tool using GTK+ and GStreamer.

Do the usual configure/make/make install malarky, and run
"sound-juicer" in $(prefix)/bin or "CD Ripper" in Applications ->
Sound & Video.

GStreamer 0.6.1 (in CVS atm) is required for the Ogg tagging to work
correctly -- you'll get invalid tag messages with 0.6.0.
